# GameScoreboard â€“ Aptos Move Module

## ðŸ“Œ Description
**GameScoreboard** is a simple smart contract module written in the Move language for the Aptos blockchain.  
It enables players to maintain and update their own game scores securely on-chain.  
Each player has their own personal scoreboard, which is initialized with a score of `0` and can be updated by adding points.

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision
To provide an easy-to-use, transparent, and secure on-chain scoreboard system for games and competitions built on the Aptos blockchain.  
The module aims to be a foundation for more complex game logic, achievements, and reward systems.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
- **Leaderboards**: Maintain a global leaderboard ranking players by score.
- **Score History**: Record score changes over time for analytics and replay.
- **Achievements & Rewards**: Trigger rewards or badges when players reach milestones.
- **Multi-game Support**: Track scores for multiple games per player.
- **Integration with Game Engines**: Provide APIs to connect with Unity, Unreal Engine, or web-based games.
